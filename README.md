# The Hot New Job 

An article that I found interesting was
[The Hot New Job That Pays Six Figures](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/11/the-hot-new-job-that-pays-six-figures-ai-prompt-engineering/?sh=4d84a5ed7d7f).

*The article covers how prompt engineering is the hottest job lately, and I found it intriguing how it mentioned that people looking to hire prompt engineers aren't looking for those who are especially technically knowledgeable.*

<p>Since the rise of LLMs like GPT, I've personally found that prompt engineering takes a lot of creativity and many many iterations to create a solid prompt that outputs exactly what you want. </p>

Earlier this year, my friend and I did an experiment to see if we could switch roles in creating a web application. While usually he would do the design side of things and I would do the coding, we swapped roles and he used chatGPT to code the application, and I used Midjourney to help me design components for the frontend. Here was our final result: [Personify](https://personify.bio/) . I was very impressed that having little previous coding background, he got a basic working web application completed within a week. 

<p>I think it's interesting that perhaps those who study humanities or other less technical fields might have a leg up in a way compared to technical people in this new age of technology. With the rise in AI, different technologies are definitely more accessible to people who might not have access otherwise. Maybe alongside more 'software engineering' courses, we might one day also add 'prompt engineering' courses to the curriculum :)</p>
